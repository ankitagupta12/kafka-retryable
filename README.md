# Kafka::Retryable

Consumer failures are common for Kafka consumers, and if these are left unhandled, it can lead to data losses. There are many ways to buffer and retry messages that encounter failures. The aim of `kafka-retryable` is to provide multiple types of failure handling policies that can be used depending on the need.   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kafka-retryable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kafka-retryable

## Usage

`kafka_retryable` currently only supports failure buffers via `kafka`, and will soon support failure handling policies using other queueing systems for buffers and retry mechanisms.

1. Start with declaring configuration parameters for your class using the following syntax:

```
Class KafkaConsumer
  include Kafka::Retryable::HandleFailure
    
  failure_handler buffer: :kafka, 
                  dead_letter_queue: :topic_t1, 
                  exception_blacklist: [Karafka::InvalidMessageError],
                  after_failure: ->(error, message) { Bugsnag.notify("#{error}-#{message}") }
                 
  def consume
    # Message consumption logic goes here
  end
end
```

- `dead_letter_queue`: Topic where the consumer should enqueue the failure message.
- `exception_blacklist`: List of exception classes for which the error handling logic does not apply
- `exception_whitelist`: List of exception classes for which the error handling logic should apply
- `after_failure`: Accepts a proc that is executed after failure handling is completed

If `exception_blacklist` and `exception_whitelist` are both missing, then the error handling logic will apply for all exception classes.   

2. Enclose message processing logic inside `handle_failure(message)` helper method provided by `kafka-retryable`

```
handle_failure(message) do
  MessageProcessor.new(message).perform
end
```

Overall, this is how Kafka Consumers using `kafka-retryable` will look like:

```
Class KafkaConsumer
  include Kafka::Retryable::HandleFailure
    
  failure_handler buffer: :kafka, 
                           dead_letter_queue: :topic_t1, 
                           exception_blacklist: [Karafka::InvalidMessageError],
                           after_failure: ->(error, message) { Bugsnag.notify("#{error}-#{message}") }
    
  def consume
    handle_failure(message)
      # Message consumption logic goes here
    end
  end
end
```

`kafka-retryable` will make sure any exceptions outside the `exception_blacklist` will cause the message to be enqueued into the `dead_letter_queue` specified in the `failure_handler` configuration.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
